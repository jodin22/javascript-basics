    <h1>Number guessing game</h1>

    <p>We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you if your guess was too high or too low.</p>

    <div class="form">
      <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
      <input type="text" id="guessField" class="guessField">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit">
    </div>

    <div class="resultParas">
      <p class="guesses"></p>
      <p class="lastResult"></p>
      <p class="lowOrHi"></p>
    </div>

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100

    // Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 1

    // Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is

    // Once a guess has been submitted first record it somewhere so the user can see their previous guesses

    // Next, check whether it is the correct number

    /* If it is correct: 
    Display congratulations message
    Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up)
    Display control allowing the player to restart the game */

    /* If it is incorrect and the player has turns left:
    Tell the player they are wrong and whether their guess was too high or too low
    Allow them to enter another guess
    Increment the turn number by 1 */

    Tell the player it is game over
    Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up)
